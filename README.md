# 🧠 My LeetCode Submissions

Welcome to my personal repository where I keep track of all my LeetCode problem submissions. This is a collection of solutions I've written while practicing coding problems to strengthen my skills in data structures, algorithms, and problem solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a problem and includes:
- The solution file(s) (`.py`, `.cpp`, `.java`, `.swift`, etc.)
- A `README.md` file describing the problem (optional)
- Any notes or comments I found useful during or after solving

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Binary Search
- Stack / Queue
- Sliding Window
- Union Find
- and more...

## 🚀 Goals

- Practice consistently to improve problem-solving speed and accuracy.
- Document clean, readable, and optimized solutions.
- Track progress and revisit problems periodically.
- Prepare for coding interviews and assessments.

## 🛠 Languages Used

Most of the solutions are written in:
- Python 🐍
- C++ 💻
- Java ☕
- Swift 🧭 (especially for iOS-related practice)

## 📌 Notes

- Code is written with clarity and readability in mind.
- Some problems may contain multiple approaches (brute-force, optimized, etc.).
- Comments are added to explain thought process and logic.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal repo, but if you find something useful or want to collaborate on similar practice, feel free to fork or open an issue.

## 📅 Progress Tracker (Optional)

You can add a badge or markdown checklist to track your solved problems by difficulty or topic.
